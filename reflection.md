<Q1 design process>
plan →find what is needed
design →how to meet needs
develop → 
evaluate
implement

<Q2 why do we have the success criteria>
By having the success criteria, it defines which programs are sucsessful/meets the needs and purpose of the client.
It also shows where the code can improve.
[The promise you have as a developer]

<Q3what do you understad now about computers/computer sciece that youu did not before?>
I understand that computers are a advanced technology that supports our daily lives. Especially for computer science, I think that the functions we use first stared from the level we are learning right now. Also I think that computer scinece is much more logical than I thought it would. Although it is hard, I think that the ways a code is made is efficient and is certainly 

<Q4 what o you understand now about yourself that you did not before unit1>
before unit 1 I thought that I was going to struggle so much in computere science. I am indeed, but more than that, I find my self enjoying the learning process. I thought that it was going to be hard since I do not have any knowledge to start with. And I thought that I would not like the corse at all. But the way the codes work and because the reason why a code works and why it shows errors are clear and that was very new to me.
  
<what worked well/ did now work well during the developent of the unit 1>
  [did well]
For me, thinking of the user worked well for me. I feel that no matter how good of a code you write, if the user does not understand how to use it, it does not meet the needs. I think that when I develop I think of the user and re write my codes/instructions.
 
[needs improvement]
What I could do better is to have more knowledge. I realised that I make similar mistakes, which coule have been prevented if I have practiced multiple times. Because I tend to use so much time on one question, i think that handling an amount of problems will be better.
 Also I found out that I make errors in my code because I have less knowledge. For example, i could have saved so much time on my game code, if I knew that you cannot import functions around. If I had that time, I could have developed the game more. So now I think I really need to practice as much as I can
  
Q8 is a developer responsible for only the sucsess criteria.
  I think that the sucsess criteria is the minimum quantity of what you should meet. It will be usable when that is met, but that does not mean that it is easy to use or user friendly. So, I think the developer first should meet the sucsess criteria, and then, add print functions that would make it easier for the user. Becuase tackling all this at once takes time, and I have had an big delay in schedule because of that, from experience, I would say that the developer is responsible with meeting the sucsess criteria, and should consider if it is user friendly after that.
  
Q9
To beable to make the codes be fixed by someone else, adding comments would be able to help the situation become worse.
